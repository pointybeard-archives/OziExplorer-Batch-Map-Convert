# OziExplorer Batch Map Convert #

- Version: 0.9 alpha
- Date: 8th January 2010
- Github Repository: <http://github.com/pointybeard/OziExplorer-Batch-Map-Convert/tree/master>

## Synopsis

The OziExplorer map format (.OZF) is a closed proprietary format. As such, there are no 3rd party programs that can read/write this format.

This application allows for batch conversion of .OZF files via the OziExplorer API which can then be used easily with other raster map/image applications.

Please be aware that this is in an early stage of development and likely is buggy.


## Requirements

- Visual Basic 6 (to compile) or VB6 runtime to use the included binary
- OziExplorer v3.95.2 or above
- OziExplorer API v1.08 or above (<http://www.oziexplorer3.com/oziapi/oziapi.html>)
